One of the podcasts I currently follow is the [Tim Ferriss show](https://tim.blog/podcast/). A lot of his guests are incredible people (some examples are [Kevin Systrom](https://tim.blog/2019/04/25/kevin-systrom/) or [LeBron James](https://tim.blog/2018/11/27/lebron-james-mike-mancias/)), and they talk about their background and their philosophy in a very personal way, which makes the episodes not only interesting but also very easy to follow, like a totally casual conversation. An episode I recently listened was [his interview to Derek Sivers](https://tim.blog/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/). I have to admit that it was the first time I heard about him, but it was definitely one of the episodes I've enjoyed the most of the ones I've listened so far; if you have some spare time, I definitely recommend it.

At some point of the episode, they mention that Derek Sivers has speaked several time at TED conferences and that one of his talks was really interesting, so I decided to watch it. However, as I couldn't remember which one it was specifically, I watched the three that I found. I ended up completely amazed by the talks. Despite they are incredibly short (3 minutes each), they are incredibly eye-opening, way more than you'd expect from a 2-minutes speech.

My personal favourite is ["Weird? Or just different?"](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_weird_or_just_different), because it can make you realize that you assume things that you probably never thought about. The other ones are ["How to start a movement"](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_how_to_start_a_movement) and ["Keep your goals to yourself"](https://www.ted.com/talks/derek_sivers_keep_your_goals_to_yourself), with personal tips about leadership (or better said, 'followership') and about better ways to achieve your goals. 

You need less than 10 minutes, so stop whatever you're doing and watch them now. I am sure that you won't regret it at all!
